# ShopConnect ðŸ›’âš¡

## Introduction
Personalized eCommerce powered by ZKP, utilizing a novel Proof-of-Purchase system using Polygon ID. Future work would include using Sismo for custom data attestation, and Safe for a complete account abstraction UX.

## Technology & Components
1) ShopConnect Extension:  
This is a Chrome extension wrapped around Polygon ID. We've based it on the original Polygon ID extension, and converted it into a smooth onboarding flow for eCommerce customers to quickly unlock personalized deals. This extension stores the user's proofs of purchase privately, and shares only proofs for eligible promotions.

2) ShopConnect Plugin:  
It is designed to integrate ShopConnect with different e-commerce platforms, providing both interacction with the platform's backend and the browser extension. We have implemented as part of the same codebase as the store, for simplicity, but could be made into it's own plugin that could interact with Shopify, WooCommerce and other e-commerce platforms. It consists of frontend code, that interacts with the extension and the store's backend, and backend code that adds ShopConnect-specific endpoints.

3) ShopConnect API:
This backend server exposes endpoints that connect the extension, backend, and stores together. All requests to issue new Verifiable Credentials are made through the API, and requests to verify credentials in a user's wallet are also made through the API. ShopConnect operates an Issuer Node on the backend, allowing it to issue VCs whenever a purchase is made.

4) Polygon ID:  
The Iden3 State V2 Smart Contracts have been deployed on multiple chains, including Scroll Sepolia, Mantle Testnet and Polygon zkEVM testnet (although zkEVM testnet is pending a fix by the zkEVM team before the deployment can be fully functional). We've also deployed on our Issuer Node to issue Verifiable Credentials with a custom eCommerce schema.

Mantle Testnet: 0x07C5A5B65D9bFC8F6F40d74d14DA64561204E5e7  
Polygon zkEVM: 0x07C5A5B65D9bFC8F6F40d74d14DA64561204E5e7   

5) Store Mockup:  
We have developed a very simple demo e-commerce store to facilitate the development and showcase of the main application. Built with NextJS & Tailwind
